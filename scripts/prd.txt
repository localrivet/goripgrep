# Product Requirements Document: GoRipGrep
## A High-Performance Golang Library for Text Search

### Executive Summary

**Project Name:** GoRipGrep  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Target Audience:** Go developers, DevOps engineers, CLI tool builders  
**Project Goal:** Create a high-performance, feature-complete Golang library that provides the same functionality as Rust's ripgrep, enabling developers to build fast text search applications and tools.

### 1. Project Overview

#### 1.1 Background
Ripgrep (rg) is currently the fastest and most feature-rich text search tool available, written in Rust. It combines the usability of The Silver Searcher with the raw performance of GNU grep, while adding modern features like gitignore support, Unicode handling, and advanced regex capabilities. However, there is no equivalent high-performance library available for the Go ecosystem.

#### 1.2 Problem Statement
- Go developers lack access to a high-performance text search library equivalent to ripgrep
- Existing Go text search solutions are either too basic or lack the performance optimizations found in ripgrep
- Building search-intensive applications in Go requires either calling external tools or accepting suboptimal performance
- No Go library provides ripgrep's advanced features like gitignore support, file type filtering, and optimized regex engines

#### 1.3 Solution Overview
GoRipGrep will be a pure Go library that replicates ripgrep's functionality and performance characteristics, providing:
- High-performance text search with SIMD optimizations where possible
- Full Unicode support with configurable ASCII-only modes for performance
- Gitignore and file filtering capabilities
- Multiple regex engine support (Go's regexp and optional PCRE2 bindings)
- Parallel directory traversal and search
- Comprehensive API for building search applications

### 2. Market Analysis

#### 2.1 Target Users
- **Primary:** Go developers building CLI tools, code search applications, log analysis tools
- **Secondary:** DevOps engineers creating monitoring and analysis tools
- **Tertiary:** Enterprise developers building internal search and analysis platforms

#### 2.2 Competitive Analysis
| Tool/Library | Language | Performance | Features | Go Integration |
|--------------|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| ripgrep | Rust | Excellent | Complete | External binary only |
| grep | C | Good | Basic | External binary only |
| The Silver Searcher | C | Good | Moderate | External binary only |
| Go regexp | Go | Moderate | Basic | Native |
| Go filepath.Walk | Go | Poor | Basic | Native |

#### 2.3 Market Opportunity
- Growing Go ecosystem needs high-performance text processing libraries
- Increasing demand for fast code search and analysis tools
- Enterprise need for embeddable search capabilities
- DevOps tooling requiring efficient log and file analysis
